## About the project title
Firelands is an apartment building at Oberlin College, OH. Known to be a senior
dorm, it hosts seniors who want to live in singles and want to be left alone to
focus on their work while having a peaceful year until their graduation. Despite
being a decent college housing option and its popularity among Oberlin students,
Firelands is a bare minimum living space that asks for some decoration and
attention. With Firelands, you can create the perfect personal office, a great
cocktail party room, or both.
